Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

You were a lowly ensign serving aboard the starship Venture when suddenly the alarm sounded.  You felt the ship lurch and buck while you ran to the nearest escape pod, but something went horribly wrong.  Before you could safely strap into your acceleration couch, a large explosion cast you about the pod and you hit your head hard. The last thing you remember is hearing frantic pleas for help over the radio.  Unkown hours later you regain consciousness, floating in the middle of a tropical ocean on an alien world.

Ocean Waves
 You lay on your back in the warm water as the waves lift your body up and down rythmically.  The sun's relentless heat beats down on you and the salt spray stings your eyes. The sea laps against your face and sometimes over it.  When it does, you spout like a tiny human whale.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

.... You are floating in the middle of a tropical ocean.  You hoped that the cruise ship would notice you were missing, but it's been hours, and no ship has appeared on the horizon. You deeply regret trying to stop your phone from falling over the railing of the ship. Now look what's happened.

Ocean Waves

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely.

You were a lowly ensign serving aboard the starship Venture when suddenly the alarm sounded.  You felt the ship lurch and buck while you ran to the nearest escape pod, but something went horribly wrong.  Before you could safely strap into your acceleration couch, a large explosion cast you about the pod and you hit your head hard. The last thing you remember is hearing frantic pleas for help over the radio.  Unkown hours later you regain consciousness, floating in the middle of a tropical ocean on an alien world.

Ocean Waves
 You lay on your back in the warm water as the waves lift your body up and down rythmically.  The sun's relentless heat beats down on you and the salt spray stings your eyes. The sea laps against your face and sometimes over it.  When it does, you spout like a tiny human whale.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

A grey fin emerges from the waves. Adrenaline kicks in, but you manage to hold yourself together.  You guide your make-shift sailboard away from the creature until the fin submerges. For a moment you feel somewhat relieved, and then you wonder where the creature has gone to.

Darkness covers the island, and the stars stand out brightly in the canvas of the sky.  The things going bump in the night haven't killed you yet and you've had an extemely long day. You find your eyelids slipping closed and your head nods.  You fight to stay awake, worried about the unknown, but you are so tired that you don't care any more.  You fall into a deep, restful and dreamless sleep.
You awake with the sun shining hotly into your eyes from the east.  You get up and stretch.  A deep yawn escapes your lips, and then your stomach growls ominously with out warning. You are incredibly hungry, and a bit thirsty too.

Your stomach aches with hunger. You better find something to eat soon.

Darkness covers the island, and the stars stand out brightly in the canvas of the sky.  The things going bump in the night haven't killed you yet and you've had an extemely long day. You find your eyelids slipping closed and your head nods.  You fight to stay awake, worried about the unknown, but you are so tired that you don't care any more.  You fall into a deep, restful and dreamless sleep.
You awake with the sun shining hotly into your eyes from the east.  You get up and stretch.  A deep yawn escapes your lips, and then your stomach growls ominously with out warning. You are incredibly hungry, and a bit thirsty too.

Your stomach aches with hunger. You better find something to eat soon.

        <result xml:space="preserve">A dark ominous shape swims up from below and you suddenly decide that it would be better not to get back into the water.

Wind is 2 and sail is 3 and the island is -1.
You've almost made it to the island.

A grey fin emerges from the waves. Adrenaline kicks in, but you manage to hold yourself together.  You guide your make-shift sailboard away from the creature until the fin submerges. For a moment you feel somewhat relieved, and then you wonder where the creature has gone to.
Suddenly the shark reappears next to your board.  This time it is too quick.  Eons of evolution has turned it into the perfect predator. You look over and see a big toothy grin. You imagine he's your pal, just surfing along with you on the waves, having a good time. It's easier that way.  The end comes in the blink of eye.

.... You are floating in the middle of a tropical ocean.  You hoped that the cruise ship would notice you were missing, but it's been hours, and no ship has appeared on the horizon. You deeply regret trying to stop your phone from falling over the railing of the ship. Now look what's happened.

Ocean Waves
....  You lay on your back in the warm water as your body floats up and down the rythmic waves. The hot sun beats down on you and there is not a cloud in the clear blue sky.  Say look, or north, east, west south to move.

Rippling Waves

You think you must have hit your head against the ship during the fall, because a small raised lump on the back of your skull is throbbing.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

You are floating in the middle of a tropical ocean.  You hoped that the cruise ship would notice you were missing, but it's been hours and hours, and no ship has appeared on the horizon. You deeply regret trying to stop your phone from falling over the railing of the ship.  Now look what's happened.

Ocean Waves
 You lay on your back in the warm water as the waves lift your body up and down rythmically.  The sun's relentless heat beats down on you and the salt spray stings your eyes. The sea laps against your face and sometimes over it.  When it does, you spout like a tiny human whale.

You drape the jacket over the stick by the collar.
The wind catches the jacket and pulls you along over the waves.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as the wind blows your makeshift sail. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

You were a lowly ensign serving aboard the starship Venture when suddenly the alarm sounded.  You felt the ship lurch and buck while you ran to the nearest escape pod, but something went horribly wrong.  Before you could safely strap into your acceleration couch, a large explosion cast you about the pod and you hit your head hard. The last thing you remember is hearing frantic pleas for help over the radio.  Unkown hours later you regain consciousness, floating in the middle of a tropical ocean on an alien world.

Ocean Waves
 You lay on your back in the warm water as the waves lift your body up and down rythmically.  The sun's relentless heat beats down on you and the salt spray stings your eyes. The sea laps against your face and sometimes over it.  When it does, you spout like a tiny human whale.

Ocean Waves
 You lay on your back in the warm water as the waves lift your body up and down rythmically.  The sun's relentless heat beats down on you and the salt spray stings your eyes. The sea laps against your face and sometimes over it.  When it does, you spout like a tiny human whale.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as a westward wind blows your makeshift sail.  The sail is in the center position and the wind fills it nicely. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as the wind blows your makeshift sail.  The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

 You lay on your back in the warm water as the waves lift your body up and down rythmically.  The sun's relentless heat beats down on you and the salt spray stings your eyes. The sea laps against your face and sometimes over it.  When it does, you spout like a tiny human whale.

Rippling Waves
 You see a piece of wood about six feet in length. You swim over and cling to it gratefully. You look at the wood, and a chill goes through you. This is actually a board that has been roughly hewn from log.

The wind catches the jacket and pulls you along over the waves.

White Caps
You rush along the tops of the white caps as the wind blows your makeshift sail.  The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so sending a spray into almost knocking you from the board.  You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

You continue to be totally swept along westward toward the sun that hangs over the sea in the sky.  You begin to see something peeking above the horizon of waves in the distance.

You rush along the tops of the white caps as the wind blows your makeshift sail.  The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board.

Ocean Waves
 You lay on your back in the warm water as the waves lift your body up and down rythmically.  The sun's relentless heat beats down on you and the salt spray stings your eyes. The sea laps against your face and sometimes over it.  When it does, you spout like a tiny human whale.

You see an human shape floating face down in the water.

On the body is a jacket (on which is a pocket (in which is a knife)).

Rushing Waves (on the piece of wood)
You rush along the tops of the waves as the wind blows your makeshift sail. The board is slippery and wet and hits the occasional wave just so, sending a spray into your face, almost knocking you from the board. You cling to the fragile looking stick of driftwood desperately hoping that it will hold and keep you on the board.

To get more, say "help" followed by whatever it is you want to get help on.. For example, you can say "help basics" to see the most important IF commands.

These are the commands you will use most often. 

"look": Look around the room -- repeat the description of everything you see. 
"examine": Look more closely at something -- learn more about it. 
"inventory": List everything you're carrying. 
"north", "south", "east", "west", etc., etc.: Walk in some direction. 

For more about these commands -- or any command used in this game -- say "help" followed by the command word. For example, "help look".

"examine": Look more closely at something. 

(You can abbreviate this as "x".) 

Inspect an object carefully. You can do this to anything you're carrying, and anything nearby -- most anything you encounter in the game. 

You will often learn more about things if you "examine" them. However, if the game replies "You see nothing special about that," then it's probably not important. If the game replies "You can't see any such thing," then it's definitely not important. 

You can even examine yourself: "x myself" or "x me". This may tell you more about yourself -- information to help you understand the character you are playing. Then again, it may not.

The &gt; sign is where the game says, "Okay, what do you want to do now?"  You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.

The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you're carrying, as well.

Once you've gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.



Please press SPACE to continue.

These are the commands you will use most often. 

"look": Look around the room -- repeat the description of everything you see. 
"examine": Look more closely at something -- learn more about it. 
"inventory": List everything you're carrying. 
"north", "south", "east", "west", etc., etc.: Walk in some direction. 

For more about these commands -- or any command used in this game -- say "help" followed by the command word. For example, "help look".

.... You are on a beautiful island beach. To the east there is nothing but ocean for as far as the eye can see. This white sand beach extends north and south.  To the west is a lush jungle of green vegetation.

....  You continue to swim and are getting tired.  There is a stick of very wet driftwood here, about six feet long and and three inches thick.

You can also see a jacket, a piece of wood and a palm tree here.

You can't reach into Rippling Waves.

Your stomach aches with hunger. You better find something to eat soon.

What next?  You can say, help, to get more information on how to play.</result>

Animal Trail
.... Under the thick canopy of trees large leafed plants gather what sunlight they can. Dead branches litter the ground. Some kind of animals have beaten down a narrow path between the vegetation.  The path leads west into the jungle and east to the White Sand Beach.

.... There is a small pool of water about twenty feet in diameter here. It appears to be fed by a stream flowing out of the jungle in the west. The water is so crystal clear that you can easily see the bottom. In the pool, several fish of varying sizes and spectacular colors swim leisurely about in the warm water.

You can see a pool (in which are a yellow fish, a speckled fish and a striped fish) here.

A little stream flows out from the jungle here. The banks are lined with thin saplings and the vegetation is so thick that the only way further to go further west is to wade into the steam.

You can see Saplings here.

Lagoon
.... There is a small pool of water about twenty feet in diameter here. It appears to be fed by a stream flowing out of the jungle in the west. The water is so crystal clear that you can easily see the bottom. In the pool, several fish of varying sizes and spectacular colors swim leisurely about in the warm water.

You can see a pool (in which are a yellow fish, a speckled fish and a striped fish) here.

Lagoon
.... There is a small pool of water about twenty feet in diameter here. It appears to be fed by a stream flowing out of the jungle in the west. The water is so crystal clear that you can easily see the bottom. In the pool, several fish of varying sizes and spectacular colors swim leisurely about in the warm water.

You can see a pool (in which are a yellow fish, a speckled fish and a striped fish) here.

White Sand Beach
.... You are on a beautiful island beach. To the east there is nothing but ocean for as far as the eye can see. This white sand beach extends north and south.  To the west is a lush jungle of green vegetation.

You can see a pile of ashes, a knife, a stick, a jacket, a piece of wood and a palm tree here.

Lagoon
.... There is a small pool of water about twenty feet in diameter here. It appears to be fed by a stream flowing out of the jungle in the west. The water is so crystal clear that you can easily see the bottom. In the pool, several fish of varying sizes and spectacular colors swim leisurely about in the warm water.

You can see a pool (in which are a yellow fish, a speckled fish and a striped fish) here.

Lagoon
.... There is a small pool of water about twenty feet in diameter here. It appears to be fed by a stream flowing out of the jungle in the west. The water is so crystal clear that you can easily see the bottom. In the pool, several fish of varying sizes and spectacular colors swim leisurely about in the warm water.

You can see a pool (in which are a yellow fish, a speckled fish and a striped fish) here.

Rippling Waves
 You see a piece of wood about six feet in length. You swim over and cling to it gratefully. You look at the wood, and a chill goes through you. This is actually a board that has been roughly hewn from log.
